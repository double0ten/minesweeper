Write a function which consumes three arguments width height number_of_mines and generates a Minesweeper board internally. The board is a rectangle with a cover over each square. It will display this board to the user and prompt for a coordinate where they predict that no mine exists (format: x-coord y-coord 0-indexed). If they struck a mine then they lose (let them know). Otherwise uncover the selected square. If there are no adjacent mines then it should be blank and you uncover all adjacent squares too (chain-react this for every blank square). Otherwise show the number of mines in the surrounding 8 squares. If at somepoint only mines are covered then the user wins and the game ends.\r\n<br>We do a lot of random thing in this project, every match has different location of miner since the whole game is generated by random. Users could input the location he wants to go step by step until finish the game or encounter a miner.\r\n<br>If you want to see **\"README\"**, please click **\"View on GitHub\"** on the left side.",
